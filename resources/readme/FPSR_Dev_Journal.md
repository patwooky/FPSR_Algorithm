## Introduction to The Story of FPSR
This document traces the evolution of an idea‚Äîborn of necessity, shaped through exploration, and ultimately expressed as a toolkit for achieving structured randomization. It exists partly for posterity, partly as a personal record‚Äîbecause memory, for all its mystique, tends to favor noise over signal, and often forgets with surprising precision.

It may also serve as a case study in how a random idea can evolve into‚Äîwell, an idea for randomness. Perhaps it will encourage us to question assumptions, to look beyond what's readily available, and to forge tools where none yet exist‚Äînot by chance, but by design.

## üß† Genesis Notes: From Self-Discovery to Structured Toolkit

### The Early Solution: Loop-Hold Modulus

Years before FPS-R had a name, I stumbled on a fragment of the solution:  
```python
frame - (frame % 20)
```

At the time, it felt clever‚Äîa minimal way to hold a value for 20 frames by snapping frame numbers to steps. Later I learned this was fairly standard in shader logic. Each jump resets the frame anchor, producing a new random seed. Simple and effective.

But it had a flaw I couldn‚Äôt unsee: its rhythm was too clean. The cyclic period (e.g., 20 frames) became predictable. The texture flattened.

### The Manual Anti-Regularity Experiments
To break the monotony, I started stacking versions of the modulus trick:
```python
frame - (frame % 20)
19 + frame - ((19 + frame) % 16)
frame - (frame % 11)
```

### QS: The Devil‚Äôs Advocate That Stayed
Quantised Switching (QS) wasn't born heroic. It was a counter-argument. A devil‚Äôs advocate. A deliberate attempt to break my belief that Stacked Modulo (SM) was novel.

I modeled QS after my early approaches‚Äîposterized sine waves, alternating patterns, layered frequency. At first, it felt crude. Posterizing into 10 or 20 steps meant my random seed pool was small. Graphing the random output exposed resonant values‚Äîclusters that repeated more than they should.

In that moment, SM stood taller. It delivered cleaner entropy and held its ‚Äústructured chaos‚Äù promise more convincingly.

But I couldn‚Äôt unsee the personality in QS. Even with its flaws, it had attitude‚Äîlike a dancing robot with too much choreography and not enough battery. And eventually, after refinement, it found its own rhythm.

---
### The Turning Point: From One Method to a Toolkit
Initially, I only imagined one algorithm. SM was the flagship. QS was the challenger, the second-class citizen.

But letting go of that bias became liberating. Eventually I realized‚Äîthese weren‚Äôt alternatives. They were tools. Two distinct pathways to the same design philosophy: rhythm that misbehaves with purpose.

That‚Äôs when FPS-R stopped being an algorithm‚Äîand started becoming a framework.
